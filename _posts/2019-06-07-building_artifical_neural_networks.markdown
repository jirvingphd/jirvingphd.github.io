# A Beginner's Guide to Playing (Artificial) God

Coming from a neuroscience background, performing _in vivo_ electrophysiology experiments (recording and analyzing the electrical activity of neuorns), I was intrigued when first exposed to artificial neural networks (ANNs). 

My understanding of the  neural circuitry, neurotransmission, and neuroplasticity gave me a very strong intuitive understanding of how they work. But an intuitive understanding vs. practical usability are _not_ the same thing...

Below we will first dive into a high-level primer on how neurons communicate before turning to designing ANNs.
